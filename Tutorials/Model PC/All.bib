	Abstract = {This paper presents a demand-led growth model grounded in a co- herent
	stock-flow monetary accounting framework, where all stocks and flows
	are accounted for. Wealth is allocated between assets on Tobinesque
	principles, but no equilibrium condition is necessary to bring the
	``demand'' for money into equivalence with its ``supply.'' Growth
	and profit rates, as well as valua- tion, debt, and capacity utilization
	ratios are analyzed using simulations in which a growing economy
	is assumed to be shocked by changes in interest rates, liquidity
	preference, real wages, and the parameters that determine how firms
	finance investment. },

	an asset pricing model. A relatively stylized model is shown to generate
	persistent swings of asset prices from their fundamental values which
	replicates long range samples of U.S financial data. The detailed
	mechanisms of the learning models are then explored. Evidence suggests
	that agents' perceptions of risk and its dynamics and persistence
	are important in generating appropriate price/fundamental dynamics.
	Agents putting large amounts of weight on the recent past in their
	volatility models control a large fraction of wealth, and are important
	in perpetuating the volatility magnifying dynamics of the market.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of financialisation and functional
	income distribution on aggregate demand in the USA by estimating
	the effects of the increase in rentier income (dividends and interest
	payments) and housing and financial wealth on consumption and investment.
	The redistribution of income in favour of profits suppresses consumption,
	whereas the increase in the rentier income and wealth has positive
	effects. A higher rentier income decreases investment. Without the
	wealth effects, the overall effect of the changes in distribution
	on aggregate demand would have been negative. Thus a pro-capital
	income distribution leads to a slightly negative effect on growth,
	i.e. the USA economy is moderately wage-led. h },

	and financialisation. Shareholder value orientation is reflected
	by a high dividend payout ratio applied by firms and the reluctance
	of firms to finance physical investment via new equity issues. Financialisation
	is the more general development towards an increased importance of
	the financial sector of the economy relative to the non-financial
	sector. In this article, a synthetic, stock-flow consistent model
	is developed that attempts to encompass some important recent works
	on the effects of financialisation. This includes contributions from
	the fields of mainstream information economics and post-Keynesian
	economics. We conduct simulations reflecting increased shareholder
	value orientation, and show that the results are consistent with
	important stylised facts.},

	Abstract = {Keynesian models of household behavior suggest that a shift in the
	distribution of income toward profits---or toward rentiers---should
	imply an increase in the propensity to save out of income for the
	population as a whole. However, the available empirical evidence
	for the United States shows that, starting in 1985, the propensity
	to save out of income for the household sector has decreased steadily.
	Starting in 1981, the share of income accruing to the richest 5 percent
	of the population increased steadily, with wide fluctuations related
	to capital gains on equities and, more recently, in the housing market.
	The aim of this paper is to lay down a growth model, grounded in
	the Post Keynesian stock-flow-consistent approach of Godley and Lavoie,
	to analyze the links between consumption and saving behavior of two
	classes of households---financial markets and the housing market.
	The model will be used from a theoretical perspective to analyze
	the dynamics of markets along a steady growth path.},

@conference{Bellofiore:2010,
	Abstract = {In the last few years many authors outside (but even inside) the mainstream have referred to the contributions of Hyman P. Minsky as fundamental to understand the current crisis. It is well known, however, that the traditional representation of Minsky's model has serious internal logical problems. As Lavoie and Seccareccia (2001) have convincingly argued, there is a macroeconomic missing link in Minsky' theory, so that leverage ratios may rise or decline during a phase of economic expansion. If leverage ratio is close to zero, also the argument (see Corbisiero 1998; Passarella 2010a) intended to strengthen Minsky -- argument based on the consideration of the mis-matching ratio (viz. whenever the spread between long-term and short-term interest widens, firms tend to finance long-term assets by means of short-term liabilities) -- loses its relevance. In this regard, notice that during the phase of the Great Moderation leverage ratios for the nonfinancial businesses were quite stable, or were increasing much less relative to the leverage ratios of the financial businesses or of households. We believe, however, that Minsky's vision can be rescued if `capital assets' are not reduced to `capital goods' (see Bellofiore 2009), and if his approach is `augmented' with Kaleckian and `circuitist' inputs. The counter-tendencies to an increase in leverage ratios for `industrial' firms are shown to be stronger than the tendency to an increase. However, they are bound to collapse sooner or later, `if anything goes wrong' (Minsky 1977), or as a consequence of the same factors contrasting the increase in the firm sector's leverage. The paper grounds this perspective through the construction of a stock-flow consistent accounting model which, on the one hand, is explicitly based on a `circuitist' view of the economy and, on the other hand, integrates capital asset inflation into it. The new shape of the monetary circuit will be described, with the help of Graziani's insight (2004) and recent contributions by Mario Seccareccia (2010). Capital asset inflation (see Toporowski 2000, 2010) will be shown to be the main force explaining, first, the rise in consumption beyond the limits given by income (deterioration in the wage share), and later on the `forced' indebtness of firms (see Steindl 1982; Toporowski 2008).  },

	Abstract = {{While many studies have been devoted to capital accumulation and rate of profit, the article empirically characterises the financialization at the level of firms' liability, i.e. at the level of debt and equity. In particular, the determinants of non financial firms' indebtedness and equity issuing will be analysed econometrically. The theoretical framework is mainly Post-Keynesian, with the founding role played by Minsky (1986) and with Stock Flow Consistent models proposed by Lavoie and Godley (2001), Godley and Lavoie (2007), Taylor (2004) and Dos Santos and Zezza (2008 )with their analysis of interactions between financial variables and investment. The article is based on the flow of funds accounts of INSEE which provide coherent data in flows and stocks over the period 1978-2007. Thanks to a precise account of financial assets and liabilities and capital gains, these data allow to implement a rigorous analysis of firms' financial behaviour at the macroeconomic level.}},

	Abstract = {The growth regime prevailing in France since the middle of the 1980s allowed for a recovery of profitability, yet without durable resumption of growth or accumulation of fixed capital. The financialization of this growth regime shows on both the asset and liability sides of the balance sheets. Following a post-Keynesian framework, we analyse and test the main determinants of real investment and financial capital accumulation for non-financial companies in France, based on data from the flow-of-funds accounts. This analysis points to an arbitrage, prevailing between real and financial accumulation, as a key reason explaining the insufficient recovery of investment.},

Five years after this report, his full-scale study of moneyflows appeared [49, Copeland, 1959].1 The new accounting system was hailed as expanding the potential frontier of model-building [132, Riefler, 1952]. Money-flows accounting was expected to be as popular with the next generation of economists as the GNP accounts were with the current one. 
In this survey of Copeland's work a quarter-of-a-century later, the emphasis will be on its impact on economic model-building. Briefer attention will be paid to implications for monetary theory and the later evolution of the accounts.},

	Abstract = {OUR ECONOMY HAS SUFFERED in the past from business depressions and unemployment, and in spite of the present high level of business activity there is no reason to think depressions have been eliminated. If we look beyond the immediate situation, unemployment is still our most important economic problem. Because we live in a money economy where moneyflows play an important role in organizing economic activity, a better understanding of moneyflows should help 
us toward a better understanding of the problem of maintaining reasonably full employment. 
The study in which I have been engaged aims to provide measures of moneyflows that will answer questions such as these: 
when total purchases of our national product increase where does the money come from to finance them? When purchases of 
our national product decline, what becomes of the money that is not spent? Is it hoarded, or what? Who has and exercises discretion to increase or decrease expenditures on national product? What part do Social Accounting cash balances, other liquid asset holdings, and debts play in the cyclical expansion and contraction of moneyflow?},

	Abstract = {We revisit the old but still vibrant Post-Keynesian debate over `fully-adjusted positions', defined by the long-run equality of actual and standard utilisation rates. The central proposition of this paper is that in a world where different groups inside and outside firms have different objectives, the equality of actual and standard utilisation should not be treated as the only possible long-run equilibrium condition. The argument is illustrated in a model of target return pricing with conflict inflation, building on the work of Marc Lavoie. A `common language' for the conflicting claims by shareholders, managers and workers is developed in terms of target profit rates, and it is shown that these contradictory claims can be partly reconciled through variations in the utilisation rate. The analysis unifies history and equilibrium in the sense that the nature of final equilibrium position and the adjustment to it depend on the objectives of the dominant social groups. We distinguish a `Fordist regime' and a `financialisation regime' and produce simulation results within a simple stock-flow consistent model that are broadly consistent with the stylised facts of these distinct historical phases of capitalism.},

An outline is then suggested for a model which would take all of these stock-flow effects into account, given the macro-economic data currently available. In a following paper (Davis, 1987) we give a detailed account of estimation and simulation of such a stock-flow consistent model.},

The first part (Davis, 1987) surveyed the theoretical literature on stock-adjustment dynamics, criticized existing UK forecasting models for omitting many potential stock-flow interactions and gave an outline of the model which is constructed here. The estimation and simulation results suggest that variables encapsulating such stock-flow effects are frequently significant in the estimation of key equations, and that their inclusion may make a sizeable difference to the simulation properties of a model.},

	Abstract = {Stock-flow consistent models may be considered the rallying point for heterodox authors interested in modeling macroeconomic relations, since these models incorporate real and financial relations in an entirely consistent way, therefore providing macroeconomic constraints to individual behavior. The present model expands on the Godley-Lavoie model of growth, which was based on a two-asset world, with only bank deposits and the shares issued by private corporations. The present model incorporates the financial relations among the central bank, private banks, and the fiscal policy of government, showing the endogeneity of money under different assumptions on banks' behavior. The model is used to analyze the relationship between the distribution of income and growth, and to study the impact of monetary policy.},

@article{Duwicquet:2010,
	Abstract = {In a monetary union like the euro area adjustments facing asymmetric evolutions are more difficult due to fixed intra-European exchange rates. Capital markets well integrated, with portfolio diversification, capital income transfers and intra-zone credit, would constitute a powerful adjustment mechanism, examined in detail by the ``risk sharing'' approach. This result is used by advocates of a liberal economic policy in the EU to promote a deeper financial integration. However the theoretical basis and the econometric methodology used can be both criticised. 
A different approach is adopted in this paper based on a ``stock-flow consistent'' model of a Monetary Union with two countries in the line of Godley and Lavoie (2007). Alternative versions of the model are considered. Two results can be underlined. Foreign assets holding has a stabilising role but the capital income stabilising coefficient seems smaller than the one obtained by the ``risk sharing'' approach. On the opposite, foreign loans (intra-zone credit) seem to have no specific stabilization effects. There is no increase of the stabilization coefficient to expect from development of intra-euro zone credit.},

	Abstract = {This paper uses a simulation model to describe the role which bank money and bank loans musty play when decisions by households and firms are taken under conditions of uncertainty and when production takes time. Its main purpose is to integrate the theory of money and finance into that of income determination, in what may broadly be called the Keynesian tradition. Stocks of bank money and cash are found to be irretrievably endogenous. Great importance is attached to the accounting framework which, though simplified, comprises a comprehensive system of stocks and flows which enables sequential solutions to be found. The simulation method makes it possible to pin down exactly why the model behaves as it does. The model suggests the basis for a way of looking at the world which is fundamentally different from that used in the neoclassical paradigm.},

	Abstract = {This paper first deploys a simplified accounting matrix to illustrate the concepts to be used. It will argue that macroeconomic analysis is facilitated if the main income and expenditure variables which make up the GDP are arranged in a double entry format so that they can all be seen as transactions involving at least two parties. Such a framework shows how the gap between each sector's receipts and outlays implies an equivalent rise or fall in its net acquisition of financial assets. One conclusion will be that financial balances (relative to income flows) must stay within certain limits if debts are not to grow excessively, implying that the monitoring of these balances may yield a warning that unsustainable processes are at work, with strategic implications for the conduct of policy. Furthermore, the fact that the net acquisition of financial assets by any one sector necessarily implies an equivalent change in the opposite direction in the sum of net acquisition by other sectors, has strong implications for the way in which targets for public borrowing should be set. The main conclusions will be illustrated using US and UK data. },

The first part of the paper describes a single economy on a fixed exchange rate, with no private capital flows, in order to obtain simple analytic solutions that display the basic constraints and forces at work-notably, endogenous "sterilization." The second part describes a flexible exchange rate model, with two economies trading financial assets as well as merchandise. A final section adapts the two-country model to describe a fixed exchange rate regime. Our findings challenge established results, such as those of the Mundell-Fleming model.},

	Abstract = {This paper deploys a simple stock-flow consistent (SFC) model in order to examine various contentions regarding fiscal and monetary policy. It follows from the model that if the fiscal stance is not set in the appropriate fashion---that is, at a well-defined level and growth rate---then full employment and low inflation will not be achieved in a sustainable way. We also show that fiscal policy on its own could achieve both full employment and a target rate of inflation. Finally, we arrive at two unconventional conclusions: (1) that an economy (described within an SFC framework) with a real rate of interest net of taxes that exceeds the real growth rate will not generate explosive interest flows, even when the government is not targeting primary surpluses, and (2) that it cannot be assumed that a debtor country requires a trade surplus if interest payments on debt are not to explode.},

	Abstract = {We simulate changes in financial integration between two countries in a stock-flow consistent model. Our model describes two economies that start from virtual autarky, with trade flows opening up gradually, until the countries reach full monetary union. By introducing measures of financial integration into an SFC model, we can explore the effects of fiscal and monetary policies in the presence of financial integration on output, income, wealth and households' portfolio decisions. We find that monetary union has no significant effect on the real side of the economy, but it has effect on households' portfolio distributions. On the other hand, the convergence of asset prices and returns leads to a convergence on the households demand for foreign assets. },

	Abstract = {The aim of the present paper is to build a generalized Kaleckian two-sector model with a consumption sector and an investment sector in a closed economy, on the one hand, and to explore long-run relationships with short-period and medium-period dynamics towards long-run positions, on the other hand. The model suggested here incorporates conflicting claims of labour and firms over income distribution and endogenous labour-saving technical progress. Adopting a stock-flow consistent framework that has been developed recently by Godley and Lavoie, our experiments yield interesting results as follows. First, the `paradox of thrift' and the `paradox of costs' would still hold, but the impact would be smaller than that in a model without conflicting-claims inflation and endogenous laboursaving technical progress. Second, the initial status of income distribution and monetary policy could play a crucial role in determining the magnitude of the impact, and those might make paradoxes disappear. Finally, changes in autonomous labour-saving innovation might explain the phenomenon of the "new economy'' of the second half of 1990s within an alternative framework. Our model, therefore, reinforces a post-Keynesian growth theory where aggregate demand is the most crucial determinant of long-run positions as well as short-run positions, and shows that economic growth is demand-led, rather than supply-led, characterized by the `path-dependency'.},

	Abstract = {The Conclusion

The purpose of the present chapter was to show that the systematic use of 
transactions-flow matrices, which insure that nothing has been left out hanging in 
the air and that all interdependences have been taken into account, a method 
advocated by Wynne Godley, provides coherence and formalism to the theory of 
the monetary circuit, espoused by Augusto Graziani. Taken by itself, the transactions flow matrix tells us what results occur by the end of the period. The theory of the monetary circuit allows to tell a causal story: it helps us to understand how economic activity arises, and how it is financed at the beginning of the period. 
There are great advantages, I believe, in combining the two methods, as it has been 
attempted here. Many questions which have been of concern to circuitistes and to 
post-Keynesians, for instance the role of bank profits and the impact of interest 
rates on money creation, most probably can be answered by using this framework.

	Abstract = {The paper presents a three-country stock-flow consistent model, with one fixed exchange rate and two flexible exchange rates, in the tradition of portfolio balance models with imperfect asset substitutability. The model is applied to simulate the impact of the diversification of the foreign reserves of China, away from US dollars and towards euros. The simulation results show that China and the USA both benefit from diversification, while the Euroland economy slows down. An intriguing feature of the model is that it generates path dependence.

We find that exchange rate expectations have a significant effect on exchange rate movements and trade account balances during the traverse and in steady states. A flexible exchange rate regime will continue to provide stabilizing properties, as long as the proportion of chartist actors

For that purpose, the principle of liquidity preference is generalized within a competitive banking framework. Private banks can impose a monetary rationing independently of the central bank. Then, we analyse the consequences of a monetary policy shock on the financial behaviour of banks. We clarify the dynamic process between the monetary policy and net investment within a Minskyan approach. 
First, we build a Post-Keynesian stock-flow consistent model with a private-bank sector introducing more realistic features. Second, we perform some simulations. },

	Abstract = {Following the New Classical Macroeconomics and the New Keynesian Macroeconomics, the independence of central banks significantly increased after 1990, which could preclude the coordination between the fiscal and the monetary policies. The purpose of this paper is to consider the stabilizing effects of fiscal policy within the framework of the new monetary policies implemented by independent central banks.Firstly, we build a Post Keynesian stock-flow consistent (SFC) model with a private banks sector introducing more realistic features. New Keynesian Macroeconomics replaces the three equations of the Keynesian synthesis (IS-LM-Phillips Curve) by three new equations of the new consensus: an IS relation, a Taylor Rule and a New Keynesian Phillips Curve (IS-TR-NKPC). Our Post Keynesian SFC model replaces the IS relation. Secondly, we make simulations by imposing supply shocks (cost push) corresponding to an inflationary shock. The consequences are examined for two kinds of policy mix, for two countries: (i) For country (1), monetary policy is determined by a standard Taylor rule that corresponds to a dual mandate: output gap and inflation gap. Fiscal policy has a countercyclical effect. Broadly speaking, country (1) describes the United States. (ii) For country (2), monetary policy is determined by a `truncated' Taylor rule that corresponds to a unique mandate: inflation gap only. Fiscal policy is neutralized, because we assume that the ratio of the current deficit of the Government (GD) on the GDP is constant and equal to zero, as imposed by the Maastricht Treaty. Broadly speaking, country (2) describes the European Union.},

Three SFC models are considered, the first one with a fixed dollar--yuan parity including a version with Chinese foreign reserves' diversification, the second with a flexible dollar--yuan parity which can be freely floating or following a more managed float, the third one being a generalization of the two others with flexible prices instead of constant prices. The fixity of the dollar--yuan parity limits the adjustments facing shocks and world imbalances while a more flexible dollar--yuan exchange rate appears as a powerful adjustment mechanism to reduce these imbalances.

	Abstract = {The US economy grew reasonably fast during the last quarter of 2010, and the general expectation seems to be that satisfactory growth will continue in 2011--12. This report argues that the expansion may indeed continue through 2012, and perhaps for another quarter or so in 2013. But with large deficits in the government and foreign sectors, satisfactory growth in the medium term cannot be achieved without a major, sustained increase in net export demand. This, of course, cannot happen automatically, and it certainly will not happen without either a cut in the domestic absorption of goods and services in the United States or a revaluation of the currencies of the major US trading partners. Both might impart a deflationary impulse to the rest of the world, while the latter might also cause a resumption of inflationary pressures. Following our usual custom, we make no short-term forecast. Instead, using the Levy Institute's macro model, which is rooted in a consistent system of stock and flow variables, we trace a range of possible medium-term scenarios in order to evaluate strategic predicaments and policy options, 
without being at all precise about timing.

	Abstract = {In Passarella (2011B) a kind of up-grading of Minsky's economic thought was proposed, 
in which his `financial instability hypothesis' was inter-bred with inputs from the 
current heterodox literature. This up-grading was done within a one-good model where 
capital goods were regarded as a mere portion of firms' homogeneous output. This 
simplifying hypothesis did not permit us to include explicitly the ratio of the (demand) 
price of capital assets to the supply price of capital goods -- i.e. the key analytical concept 
in Minsky's theory. This paper aims to improve the simplified model provided in 
Passarella (2011B) by considering explicitly an artificial, pure credit, closed capitalist 
economy in which production firms are split into two different sectors. The result is a 
new, although paradoxical, monetary circuit model which allows us to retrieve some of 
the most disputed results of Minsky's analysis of economic instability.

	Abstract = {n the last few years, a number of scholars has referred to the crop of contributions of Hyman 
P. Minsky as required readings to understanding the tendency of the capitalist economies to fall into recurring crises. The so-called ‚{\"A}{\^u}financial instability hypothesis`` of Minsky relies, however, on very disputed assumptions. Moreover, Minsky``s analysis of capitalism must be updated on the basis of the deep changes which, during the last three decades, have concerned the world economy. In order to overcome these theoretical difficulties, section 2 of the paper deals with the analytical structure of the financial instability theory, showing why this latter cannot be regarded as a general theory of the business cycle. Sections 3, 4 and 5 deal with a simplified, but consistent, re-formulation of some of the most disputed aspects of Minsky``s theory by cross-breeding it with inputs from the ‚{\"A}{\^u}Circuitist`` approach and the current Post Keynesian literature. In sections 6 and 7 we analyze the impact of both 
capital-asset inflation and consumer credit on the financial ‚{\"A}{\^u}soundness`` of the economy, within a simplified stock-flow consistent monetary circuit model. Some concluding remarks are provided in the last part of the paper (section 8).

	Abstract = {In the last few years, many financial analysts and heterodox economists (but even some 
‚{\"A}{\^u}dissenters`` among orthodox economists) have referred to the contribution of Hyman P. Minsky as fundamental to understanding the current crisis. However, it is well-known that the traditional formulation of Minsky``s ‚{\"A}{\^u}financial instability hypothesis`` shows serious internal logical problems. Furthermore, Minsky``s analysis of capitalism must be updated on the basis of the deep changes which, during the last three decades, have concerned the world economy. In order to overcome these theoretical and empirical troubles, this paper, first, introduces the reader to the ‚{\"A}{\^u}mechanics`` of the financial instability theory, according to the formulation of the traditional Minskian literature (section 2). Second, it shows ‚{\"A}{\^u}why`` Minsky``s theory cannot be regarded as a general theory of the business cycle 
(section 3). Third, the paper attempts to supply a simplified, but consistent, re-formulation of Minsky``s theory by inter-breeding it with inputs coming from the ‚{\"A}{\^u}New Cambridge`` theories and the current ‚{\"A}{\^u}formal Minskian literature``. The aim of this is to analyze the impact of both capital-asset inflation and consumer credit on the financial ‚{\"A}{\^u}soundness`` of the non-financial business sector (sections 4-7).

	Abstract = {This paper evaluates whether the 2011 national stability programs (SPs) of the euro area 
countries are instrumental in achieving economic stability in the European Monetary Union 
(EMU). In particular, we analyze how the SPs address the double challenge of public deficits and external imbalances. Our analysis rests, first, on the accounting identities of the public, private, and foreign financial balances; and second, on the consideration of all SPs at oncerather than separately. We find that conclusions are optimistic regarding GDP growth and fiscal consolidation, while current account rebalancing is neglected. The current SPs reach these conclusions by assuming strong global export markets, entrenched current account imbalances within the EMU as well as the deterioration of private financial balances in the current account deficit countries. By means of our simulations we conclude, on the one hand, that the failure of favorable global macroeconomic developments to materialize may lead to the opposite of the desired stability by exacerbating imbalances in the euro area. On the other hand, given symmetric efforts at rebalancing, the simulation suggests that for surplus countries that reduce their current account, a more expansionary fiscal policy will likely be required to maintain growth rates.

All models are in a structuralist / post Keynesian tradition and pay explicit attention to financial stock-flow relations.

Hicks and others, the language of macroeconomic theory became systems of simultaneous equations. These are general equilibrium systems of interdependence in the sense that the relationships describe an entire national economy, not just a particular industry or sector. The systems are usually not completely closed; they depend on exogenous parameters including instruments controlled by policymakers. Seeking definite relationships of economic outcomes to policies and other exogenous variables, qualitative and quantitative, these models sacrifice detail and generality, limiting the number of variables and equations by aggregations over agents, commodities, assets, and time. 
Theoretical macroeconomic models of one brand or another are very influential. They guide the architects of econometric forecasting models. They shape the thinking of policymakers and their advisers about "the way the world works." They color the views of journalists, managers, teachers, housewives, politicians, and voters. Almost everyone thinks about the economy, tries to understand it, and has opinions on how to improve its performance. Anyone who does so uses a model, even if it is vague and informal.},

We investigate the connections of the model to the `New Cambridge' approach, and discuss other recent approaches to the evolution of financial balances for all sectors of the economy. We will show the effects of fiscal policy in the model, and its implications for the proposed fiscal stimulus on the US economy. We show that the New Cambridge hypothesis, which claimed that the private sector financial balance would be stable relative to income in the short run, does not hold for the short term in our model, but it does hold for the medium/long term. This implies that the major impact of the fiscal stimulus in the long run will be on the external imbalance, unless other measures are taken.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to track down the origin of the global recession, which 
started in 2007, to the behaviour of the private sector in the U.S. economy. The mainstream 
interpretation of the crisis is that it originated from a low-probability shock to financial markets, and more specifically to the shadow banking sector which was not properly regulated. A new set of rules, combined with temporary measures to sustain aggregate demand, should therefore be sufficient - in the mainstream approach - to bring the economy back on its growth path. We claim instead that the crisis has its roots in the shift in income distribution towards the top quintile - a trend which is stronger in the U.S., but common to several developed economies since the 1980s - combined with an increasing role of relative consumption in households' decisions. Financial markets allowed the private sector to finance expenditure beyond real disposable income, and provided a powerful channel for the globalization of the crisis. In our view, therefore, financial markets multiplied the crisis on a global scale, and more regulation will indeed be needed, but a sustainable growth path will not be achieved unless action is taken to revert to an income distribution which allows for sustainable growth in the living standards of the median household. Our view is grounded in the stock-flow-consistent approach of Godley, which is at the heart of the macroeconomic model being used at the Levy Institute of Economics, and proven to be a useful tool for anticipating and tracking the current recession in the U.S.. We use the model to compare our results with the original ``New Cambridge'' approach, and the current debate on ``twin deficits'' and the impact of fiscal policy.

One flaw is the assumption that public sector work of this sort is less inflationary than private sector employment. A second flaw is the idea that WPA type schemes should be separate from existing employers. Once these two flaws are removed, WPA turns into a temporary employment subsidy that creates jobs with existing employers public and private. A second argument leads to the same `temporary employment subsidy' conclusion: as unemployment falls, the marginal product of labour falls, till NAIRU is reached. The above subsidy compensates for this fall, and thus reduces NAIRU. Yet a third argument leads to the same conclusion: this temporary subsidy imitates a perfect labour market, a zero unemployment scenario. Thus this subsidy should facilitate a move towards zero unemployment.},

	Abstract = {Euroland is in a crisis that is slowly but surely spreading from one periphery country to another; it will eventually reach the center. The blame is mostly heaped upon supposedly profligate consumption by Mediterraneans. But that surely cannot apply to Ireland and Iceland. In both cases, these nations adopted the neoliberal attitude toward banks that was pushed by policymakers in Europe and America, with disastrous results. The banks blew up in a speculative fever and then expected their governments to absorb all the losses. The situation was similar in the United States, but in our case the debts were in dollars and our sovereign currency issuer simply spent, lent, and guaranteed 29 trillion dollars' worth of bad bank decisions. Even in our case it was a huge mistake---but it was \&quot;affordable.\&quot; Ireland and Iceland were not so lucky, as their bank debts were in \&quot;foreign\&quot; currencies. By this I mean that even though Irish bank debt was in euros, the Government of Ireland had given up its own currency in favor of what is essentially a foreign currency-the euro, which is issued by the European Central Bank (ECB). Every euro issued in Ireland is ultimately convertible, one to one, to an ECB euro. There is neither the possibility of depreciating the Irish euro nor the possibility of creating ECB euros as necessary to meet demands for clearing. Ireland is in a situation similar to that of Argentina a decade ago, when it adopted a currency board based on the US dollar. And yet the authorities demand more austerity, to further reduce growth rates. As both Ireland and Greece have found out, austerity does not mean reduced budget deficits, because tax revenues fall faster than spending can be cut. Indeed, as I write this, Athens has exploded in riots. Is there an alternative path? In this piece I argue that there is. First, I quickly summarize the financial foibles of Iceland and Ireland. I will then-also quickly-summarize the case for debt relief or default},

They apply the FIH to open economy. To do so first they analyzed it main future 
in closed economy: they individuate the main goal of MInsky in endogenous 
fragility: 
The essence of MInsky's originality is to be found in the central 
motif of his work the thesis that forces capable of producing financial 
fragility are built into the system itself. 
Here the main components: 
1. Drive toward financial innovations 
* innovating bankers `living in the same expectational climate as busi- 
ness man' 
* profit seeking households, businesses and banks 
2. Hedge speculative and Ponzi 
⇐  2 different not entirely overlapping ways 

(a) cash flow prospects 
* outflow higher than inflow: 
However, the balance-sheet cash flows from a unit can be 
larger than the expected income receipts so that the only 
way they can be met is by rolling over or even increasing 
debt; units that roll over debt are engaged in speculative 
finance and t hose t ha t increase debt t o pay debt are 
engaged in Ponzi finance. (1986 p. 226) 
(b) change in financial market conditions 
speculative- and Ponzi-finance units are vulnerable to changes 
in interest rates - that is, to financial-market developments 
- as well as to product and factor market events: increases 
in interest rates will raise cash-flow commitments without 
increasing prospective receipts. Furthermore, as they must 
continuously refinance their positions, they are vulnerable 
to financial-market disruptions. (1986, p.233) 
→ CRITIQUE of not overlapping
 
3. making on the carry: arbitrage opportunity are endogenous (and push 
toward fragility) in an hedge prevailing economy because of 
(a) short term r < yields form owning capital assets 
(b) quasi rents from capital assets > principle and interest payment 
* on long term private debts, synchronized to their pay outs on 
quasi rents 
(c) r in short term quasi money liabilities of firms and financial institu- 
tions < liabilities used in hedge financing positions 
4. lowering conservatism barrier 
⇐ success 
5. The transmission from robustness to fragility 
* unrealistic euphoric expectations ⇒ growing economy 
6. Triggers of the crisis 
* endogenous ← reversals in present value relations take place 
* ⇐ D from speculation ⇒ r↑; w ↑; price of materials ↑ 
⇒ profit margins ↓

	Abstract = {We are in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. This 
crisis is the latest phase of the evolution of financial markets under the radical 
financial deregulation process that began in the late 1970s. This evolution has 
taken the for m of cycles in which deregulation accompanied by rapid financial 
innovation stimulates powerful financial booms that end in crises. Governments 
respond to crises with bailouts that allow new expansions to begin. As a result, 
financial markets have become ever larger and financial crises have become more 
threatening to society, which forces gover nments to enact ever larger bailouts. This 
process culminated in the current global financial crisis, which is so deeply rooted 
that even unprecedented inter ventions by affected governments have, thus far, 
failed to contain it. In this paper we analyse the str uctural flaws in the financial 
system that helped bring on the current crisis and discuss prospects for financial 
refor m.

@techreport{Dos-Santos:2004b,
	Abstract = {Although the 1970s marked the end of its hegemony in macroeconomics, Keynesian thought showed vitality in that period. The 1981 Nobel Prize lecture by James Tobin is perhaps the most well-known and clear version of the ("Old" Neoclassical) Keynesian "frontier" at the time1. According to Tobin (1982, p. 172):     
Hicks{\'\i}s 'IS-LM' version of Keynesian [theory](...) has a number of defects that have 
limited its usefulness and subjected it to attack. In this lecture, I wish to describe an 
alternative framework, which tries to repair some of those defects. (...). The principal 
features that differentiate the proposed framework from the standard macromodel are 
these: (i) precison regarding time (...); (ii) tracking of stocks (...); (iii) several assets and 
rates of return (...); (iv) modeling of financial and monetary policy operations (...); (v) 
Walras{\'\i}s Law and adding-up constraints."
 
Tobin{\'\i}s "alternative framework" is, essentially, what we mean by the stock-flow consistent approach to macroeconomic modeling (SFCA, from now on)2. As it is well known, this approach failed to conquer the hearts and minds of the profession and virtually isappeared 
from the literature in the late 1980s. Indeed, despite the significant revival of the SFCA in the 
last few years, SFC practitioners are still a minority even among Post-Keynesians.  },

	Abstract = {Most Kaleckian models assume a perfectly elastic labor supply, an assumption that is questionable for many developed economies. This paper presents simple labor-constrained Kaleckian models and uses these models to compare the implications of financialization under labor-constrained and dual-economy conditions. The paper complements the analysis in Skott and Ryoo (2008) which did not include labor-constrained Kaleckian economies. We show that for plausible parameter values the financial changes commonly associated with financialization tend to be expansionary in both dual-economy and labor-constrained settings.},

	Abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of financialisation and functional income 
distribution on aggregate demand in the USA by estimating the effects of the 
increase in rentier income (dividends and interest payments) and housing and 
financial wealth on consumption and investment. The redistribution of income in 
favour of profits suppresses consumption, whereas the increase in the rentier income 
and wealth has positive effects. A higher rentier income decreases investment. 
Without the wealth effects, the overall effect of the changes in distribution on 
aggregate demand would have been negative. Thus a pro-capital income distribution 
leads to a slightly negative effect on growth, i.e. the USA economy is moderately 
wage-led. h

	Abstract = {This paper reviews the recently published PhD thesis of Hyman P. Minsky, 
summarising its main contributions to methodology and microeconomics. These 
are aspects of economics with which Minsky is not usually associated, but which lie 
at the foundation of his later work. They include critical remarks on Cambridge 
economics. The paper then draws out some antecedents of Minsky's ideas in the 
work of Henry Simons, and highlights the Marshallian monetar y analysis that he 
adopted. It is argued that this analysis is incompatible with the Kaleckian theor y of 
profits that Minsky was later to adopt.

@article{Toporowski:2009,
	Abstract = {In this paper `financialisation' is broadly defined as a process of inflating capital markets 
or more strictly financial inflation. The paper examines some of the social, economic 
and political consequences of financial inflation for the activities of companies and the 
operations in debt markets of an increasingly financial middle class. Financial inflation 
alters the behaviour of individuals and firms, and hence the character and dynamics of the 
capitalist economy and society. The first section of the paper explains the Kalecki--Steindl 
theory of enforced company indebtedness in a middle-class society. The second section 
shows how financial inflation makes companies over-capitalised, resulting in a decline in the 
trend of long-term investment. The third section shows how forced company indebtedness is 
modified as the middle classes extend their consumption financed through inflating asset 
markets. A conclusion sketches out some of the consequences of this financialisation for 
politics, social policy, and moral and cultural attitudes.},

@article{Toporowski:2012,
	Abstract = {The monetary theory of Kalecki and Minsky is usually placed within the Post-Keynesian 
tradition, deriving from the monetary analysis of John Maynard Keynes. The paper argues 
that Kalecki and Minsky shared a common inheritance in Swedish and German monetary 
theory, rather than the Marshallian tradition. Thus the monetary analysis of Kalecki and 
Minsky emphasises the endogeneity of money through capitalist reproduction, rather than 
through the mechanisms connecting central bank money to credit creation in the banking 
system. This provides the link between the monetary theory of Kalecki and Minsky and 
modern circuit theory. },

	Abstract = {Schumpeter, a century ago, argued that boom-and-bust cycles are intrinsically related to the functioning of a capitalistic economy. These cycles, inherent to the rise of innovation, are an unavoidable consequence of the way in which markets evolve and assimilate successive technological revolutions. Furthermore, Schumpeter's analysis stressed the fundamental role played by finance in fostering innovation, in defining bank credit as the \&quot;monetary complement\&quot; of innovation. Nevertheless, we feel that the connection between innovation and firm financing has seldom been examined from a theoretical standpoint, not only by economists in general, but even within the Neo-Schumpeterian research line. Our paper aims at analyzing both the long-term structural change process triggered by innovation and the related financial dynamics inside the coherent framework provided by the stock-flow consistent (SFC) approach. The model presents a multisectoral economy composed of consumption and capital goods industries, a banking sector, and two household sectors: capitalists and wage earners. The SFC approach helps us to track the flows of funds resulting from the rise of innovators in the system. The dynamics of prices, employment, and wealth distribution among the different sectors and social groups is analyzed. Above all, the essential role of finance in fostering innovation and its interaction with the real economy is underlined.},

	Abstract = {Although the 1970s marked the end of its hegemony in macroeconomics, Keynesian thought showed vitality in that period. The 1981 Nobel Prize lecture by James Tobin is perhaps the most well-known and clear version of the ("Old" Neoclassical) Keynesian "frontier" at the time1. According to Tobin (1982, p. 172):     
Hicks{\'\i}s 'IS-LM' version of Keynesian [theory](...) has a number of defects that have 
limited its usefulness and subjected it to attack. In this lecture, I wish to describe an 
alternative framework, which tries to repair some of those defects. (...). The principal 
features that differentiate the proposed framework from the standard macromodel are 
these: (i) precison regarding time (...); (ii) tracking of stocks (...); (iii) several assets and 
rates of return (...); (iv) modeling of financial and monetary policy operations (...); (v) 
Walras{\'\i}s Law and adding-up constraints."
 
Tobin{\'\i}s "alternative framework" is, essentially, what we mean by the stock-flow consistent approach to macroeconomic modeling (SFCA, from now on)2. As it is well known, this approach failed to conquer the hearts and minds of the profession and virtually isappeared 
from the literature in the late 1980s. Indeed, despite the significant revival of the SFCA in the 
last few years, SFC practitioners are still a minority even among Post-Keynesians.  },

	Abstract = {While in 2007 it was only a financial crisis and particularly, a banking crisis, now economic growth and employment are deteriorating sharply. The aim of this chapter is to understand how the financial crisis was transformed in a global real economic crisis and how it passed through the banking behaviour. We are particularly interested in psychological variables such as the state of confidence, because these variables play a key role in the Post-Keynesian tradition through expectations. We develop a model of a `financiarized' economy suffering a strong fall in the state of confidence of banks, firms and households. In order to do so, we analysed two policy mix. We contrast a rule on public expenditures with a rule on public deficits and a usual Taylor rule with a truncated Taylor rule. In the first case, the government implements a fiscal policy with automatic stabilizers and the central bank has a dual mandate: inflation and growth. There is a co-ordination between fiscal and monetary policies. The second policy mix implements an orthodox fiscal policy (balanced budget) and the independent central bank implements inflation targeting. 
 
In the first part, we present the most important equations of a Post-Keynesian stock-flow consistent (SFC) model (Godley-Lavoie, 2007, Dos Santos-Zezza, 2004, Le Heron-Mouakil, 2008, Le Heron, 2009) with a private banks sector introducing more realistic features. We introduce the borrower's and the lender's risks from the Minskian approach. In the second part, we simulate the model to study the effects of a financial crisis on the banking behaviour within our two policy mix. The aim is to deal with the consequences of a fall in the state of confidence of banks, firms and households. We make a comparison for the two assumptions on the policy mix and we analyze the channel of transmission on the economic activity.

	Abstract = {With full stock/flow accounting respected, the two-country open economy portfolio balance model has just two independent equations for asset market clearing. It can determine home and foreign interest rates but not the exchange rate. If asset market equilibria vary smoothly over time, the balance of payments equation in the Mundell‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\`\i}Fleming model is not independent and cannot set the exchange rate either. The familiar fixed reserves/‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\`o}floating rate‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\^o} vs endogenous reserves/‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\`o}fixed rate‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\^o} dichotomy does not exist, and ‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\`o}fundamentals-based‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\^o} econometric models of the exchange rate are bound to fail. An alternative is a two-country IS/LM model with exchange rate dynamics added. Its dynamic properties under uncovered interest rate parity are briefly explored.},

	macroeconomic model is studied. Two specifications are proposed:
	"beginning-of-period" and "end-of-period" formulations in period
	models. In each case the limit of the model as the time period is
	shortened is rigorously calculated. It is shown that the two formulations
	are internally consistent, but consistent with each other only under
	assumptions of perfect foresight. A brief review of the liquidity
	preference versus loanable funds literature shows that theorists
	have used these models without explicitly noting the differences
	and inconsistencie.},

	Abstract = {Starting from the perspective of heterodox Keynesian‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\`\i}Minskyian‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\`\i}Kindlebergian
	financial economics, this paper begins by highlighting a number of
	mechanisms that contributed to the current financial crisis. These
	include excess liquidity, income polarisation, conflicts between
	financial and productive capital, lack of appropriate regulation,
	asymmetric information, principal-agent dilemmas and bounded rationalities.
	However, the paper then proceeds to argue that perhaps more than
	ever the ‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\`o}macroeconomics‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\^o}
	that led to this crisis only makes analytical sense if examined within
	the framework of the political settlements and distributional outcomes
	in which it had operated. Taking the perspective of critical social
	theories the paper concludes that, ultimately, the current financial
	crisis is the outcome of something much more systemic, namely an
	attempt to use neo-liberalism (or, in US terms, neo-conservatism)
	as a new technology of power to help transform capitalism into a
	rentiers‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\^o} delight. In particular, into a system
	without ‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\`o}compulsions‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\^o}
	on big business; i.e., one that imposes only minimal pressures on
	big agents to engage in competitive struggles in the real economy
	(while doing the opposite to workers and small firms). A key component
	in the effectiveness of this new technology of power was its ability
	to transform the state into a major facilitator of the ever-increasing
	rent-seeking practices of oligopolistic capital. The architects of
	this experiment include some capitalist groups (in particular rentiers
	from the financial sector as well as capitalists from the ‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\`o}mature‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\^o}
	and most polluting industries of the preceding techno-economic paradigm),
	some political groups, as well as intellectual networks with their
	allies‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\^\i}including many economists and the ‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\`o}new‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\^o}
	left. Although rentiers did succeed in their attempt to get rid of
	practically all fetters on their greed, in the end, the crisis materialised
	when markets took their inevitable revenge on the rentiers by calling
	their (blatant) bluff.},

	Abstract = {This paper argues that the two boom and bust episodes of the turn
	of the century‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\^\i}the internet mania and crash
	of the 1990s and the easy liquidity boom and bust of the 2000s‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\^\i}are
	two distinct components of a single structural phenomenon. They are
	essentially the equivalent of 1929 developed in two stages, one centred
	on technological innovation, the other on financial innovation. Hence,
	the frequent references to that crash, to the 1930s and to Bretton
	Woods, are not simple journalistic metaphors for interpreting the
	‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\`o}credit crunch‚{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\"o}{\"A}{\^o} and its
	solution, but rather the intuitive recognition of a fundamental similarity
	between those events and the current ones. The paper holds that such
	major boom and bust episodes are endogenous to the way in which the
	market economy evolves and assimilates successive technological revolutions.
	It will discuss why it occurred in two bubbles on this occasion;
	it examines the differences and continuities between the two episodes
